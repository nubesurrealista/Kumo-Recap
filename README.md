# Kumo Recap: 2025 edition

**Kumo-Recap** is a simple tool for viewing your annual manga reading progress from [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon), [Kumo](https://github.com/nubesurrealista/Kumo), and other fork apps.

To do this, you must convert your .tachibk backup to a .json file using [Mihon Backup Viewer](https://github.com/Animeboynz/Mihon-Backup-Viewer) or similar tools

Inspired by [Tachiwrapped](https://github.com/drosoCode/tachiwrapped) but with a more minimalist approach, without using its code (it has no license) and using a strong license such as GPLV3

### Special thanks:

- Mihon (I mean, without Mihon this wouldn't make sense)
- Mihon Backup Viewer (its schema has been used as a reference, and it's recommended to use its tool for conversion)
- Tachiwrapped (for the idea)
